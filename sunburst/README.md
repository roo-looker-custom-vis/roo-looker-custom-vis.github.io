#  Sunburst

![](sunburst.png)

This diagram creates a [sunburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart#Ring_chart_.2F_Sunburst_chart_.2F_Multilevel_pie_chart) to display hierarchical data in a nested structure.

**How it works**

Create a look with any amount of dimensions and one measure.

For example, in the sunburst featured above, you can see event counts by the hierarchical sequence of events.

Include [sunburst.js](/sunburst.js), [utils.js](../common/utils.js), and [d3.v4.js](../common/d3.v4.js)
